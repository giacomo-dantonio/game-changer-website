# Game Changer +

[Game Changer +](https://game-changer-website.vercel.app/)
is an educational game aiming to teach queer
people how to handle homophobic and transphobic aggressions.

It was our project at the [UITHACK23](https://www.unicornsintech.com/uithack23/),
the LGBTQ+ hackathon.

The goal of this year's hackathon was to prevent
violence against LGBTIQ+ people and/or provide support
to victims of said violence.
Our project won the third place.
We are very happy with our result and thankful for
the support and the trust of our fellow unicorns!

## The idea

*Game Changer +* is an RPG:
a [Role-playing video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game).
A video game enables **immersion**: that is the ability
for the player to experience something, without being exposed
to that situation in real life.

Through immersion we prepare the player for
problematic situation they may encounter in their
daily life as an LGBTQ+ person. The game teaches them
how to deal with different problematic situations and
make sure they know exactly what to do.

Another use case is to let allies experiences what
we go through in our everyday lives as queer persons
and thus raise awareness for LGBTQ+ issues.

Our approach focuses on the safety of queer persons
and is based on [nonviolent communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication).

Similar projects have already been successful
with this approach.
For example the game
[Portrait of a Texas Family](https://lookout-drive-games.itch.io/portrait-of-a-texas-family)
about a family caring for their transgender
daughter in turbulent times.

## The prototype

To demonstrate our concept we developed a prototype
during the hackathon. It is and RPG browser game, based on the framework
[RPGJS](https://rpgjs.dev/).

It is the story of
[Chalice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalice_(superhero_character)),
an LGTBQ+ super hero who is on her way to Berghain
and experiences transphobic verbal harrassment while
waiting in the queue.

The player then needs to choose between four different
reactions. Depending on the player's choice the outcome
will be different. We provide an explanation of what
happened and what would have been the best reaction.

### Try it out

The best news is: our prototype is online and you can try it out for yourself.

Visit our [landing page](https://game-changer-website.vercel.app/)
or go directly to [the game](https://game-changer-henna.vercel.app/).

### Challenges

During the hackathon we got the early feedback, that
our game could be triggering for victims of
queerphobic violence, which could relive the trauma
when playing.

To address this problem we choosed
a non-real person as the main character. In our case
the super-hero Chalice. This would reduce the potential
for identification with the character.
We also added a trigger warning to our landing page.

## Teamwork

Without exaggeration: our team experience was amazing!

During the team formation on the first day, both Bao and Giacomo pitched the same idea. After the pitches
the team got together very quickly: Bao, Eylül,
Giacomo, Nguyen, Olga, Patricia, and Robin.
The *game changers*!

We were all very excited about working on
an educational game and we quickly agreed on the
general idea. By the end of the day we had a solid
concept.

On the second day we started immediately with
the implementation of the prototype.
The team turned out to be perfectly balanced, so
that we could cover all necessary roles.

Bao was our team angel and worked on the UX and
the product management, Olga and Patricia worked
on the landing page, Giacomo and Nguyen worked on
the game, and Eylül and Robin worked on the story
and prepared the demo.

## Further steps

Our prototype is available open source on github.
We have one repository for
[the landing page](https://github.com/giacomo-dantonio/game-changer-website)
and one for [the game](https://github.com/giacomo-dantonio/game-changer).

We plan to build a community working on this project.
The next steps would be to clean up our code,
add some documentation and publish a
call for contribuitions.
